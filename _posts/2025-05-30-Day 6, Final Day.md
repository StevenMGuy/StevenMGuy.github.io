## The Last Day 
Today was a short day and the culmination of the whole week. The teachers of my class were kind enough to give us a late start today, allowing us to sleep in. This last class was a wrap-up of all we had learned and how to keep funding for our projects. It was a nice and calm day, with a bit of grumbling over the slashing of funding currently going in the US. Many US government agencies were responsible for funding different projects, but with the current administration, that burden falls on the private sector and private funders. After the end of class, we attended a conference summarizing all the other classes. There was also a presentation given on AI and Wikipedia.

A picture of that presentation can be found below.
