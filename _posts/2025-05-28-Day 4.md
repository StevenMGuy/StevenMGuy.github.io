## Deep work day
Today, I delved deeply into my class and work. As such, I didn't get to do much exploring of the city. The only notable thing was a two-for-one deal on pizzas I got for dinner. 

## Work notes
Today, we covered much more managerial material and how to lead a group in forming your digital edition. Much of the emphasis was placed on both the filing of material and optimizing the time of both yourself and those who might work with. It is imperative that all your documents and sources are filed out correctly and succinctly. This will help you as well as your users find any specific document you need. On the team management side, you should try to maximize the effectiveness of your team. If a person has a particular strength, you should assign them tasks with which they use that skill. If a person has a weakness, then you should look over their work. These kinds of things will help expedite the process of creation and help you stay on the timetable set for the project.
