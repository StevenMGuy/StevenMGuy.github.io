## A full day
Today was a full day of class, meaning close to 6 hours over the course of the day. Again, we went through the logical and logistical steps needed to be taken in order to form a digital edition. The most important point is the ability to get your digital edition out there and easily usable by your users. If it isn't able to be seen or easy to read, there is no point in making the digital edition in the first place.

## Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal
I went on my own journey exploring the area around the University of Montreal. After being let out of class, I took a few turns and saw something eye-catching far ahead of me. Seeing this majestic sight in the distance, I knew I had to explore more. So, after my second session, I ventured over and took in the sights. First, I ventured inside the museum sets. There were many sets and historical objects in the base of the mountain, building up a journey to the top. Through many elevators and stairs, I eventually reached the very top and was met with an amazing and mesmerizing view of the whole Montreal skyline. The photos I took couldn't match what I saw in person.
