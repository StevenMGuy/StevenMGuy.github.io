## The final stretch
Today was the last full day of classes. Tomorrow, we'll only have half a day of class, a bittersweet thought. Anyway, today we learned even more about the managerial details for keeping up the digital edition. Some of the most important factors you must consider when applying for grants to make your edition is both the program used to create the site, and the storage/upkeep of your site. Financial aid is needed to keep the site up with all of your work. This storage and financial need could be covered by either a financial backer or taken on by a university.
