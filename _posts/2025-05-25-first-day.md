After landing in Montreal-Trudeau airport, we explored the subways of Montreal and enjoyed a great meal in McCully's Pub. The subway system was cool and efficient, giving a cool experience. We also got to try Poutine for the first time at McCully's, and it was great! Tomorrow, all of us will take our first classes and see what is in store for a great week in Montreal. It seems it will be a wonderful experience.
