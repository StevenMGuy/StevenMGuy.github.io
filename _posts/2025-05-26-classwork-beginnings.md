## Beginnings of the journey
# Conceptualizing and Digitizing a Digital Edition
This class is about the creation of digital versions of many things, like transcripts, letters, or documents. Many of my classmates came into the class with a project in mind. They are either teachers or graduate students, so I will need to imagine my own project to continue on with the course. I think this will be a very informative course. Here are of the things I learned today:

# Project Statements
When beginning a digital edition, you should craft a project statement, a basic summary of what you will cover. This helps you formulate ideas of what you want to do, and gives future readers of what is included. In this statement, the scope, significance, practices, and other useful details should be included. 

# Editing a Digital Edition
In crafting a digital edition, there are many decisions you must make when cobbling it together. For example, if working with an old manuscript, having a picture of it might not be enough for your readers. If they are unable to read cursive or the language of the manuscript, then it is practically useless to them. Thus, you can include a transcript of the words, helping those readers. You might also have to alter a document in order to make it readable for users. If something is either spelled incorrectly or doesn't fit the grammar of the modern day, you will need to decide whether to keep the original voice of the author or make it more palatable for the viewers. All of these things must be considered when making a digital edition.

# Copyright
Copyright is very important when collecting your sources. Some images or manuscripts might be placed under copyright, which means only the owner of the copyright has the right to use it, unless they grant permission to another person. Once an item leaves the copyright, the years of which differ by country, you will have the ability to use it. But, there are also ethical questions you must keep in mind. If that source is found in a museum or familial collection, then you should still ask for permission. All of this must be considered when collecting your sources

The very first class

Afterwards, we attended a nice reception and enjoyed a nice cool day in Montreal once again. Here are some of the highlights:
