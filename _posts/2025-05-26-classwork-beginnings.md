## Beginnings of the journey
# Conceptualizing and Digitizing a Digital Edition
This class is about the creation of digital versions of many things, like transcripts, letters, or documents. Many of my classmates came into the class with a project in mind. They are either teachers or graduate students, so I will need to imagine my own project to continue on with the course.
